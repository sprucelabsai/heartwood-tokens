# Heartwood Design Tokens

Design tokens for the Heartwood design system. [https://sprucelabsai.github.io/heartwood-tokens/](https://sprucelabsai.github.io/heartwood-tokens/).

## Usage

### Sass

#### Install via yarn or npm
```bash
yarn install @sprucelabs/heartwood-tokens
```
or
```bash
npm install @sprucelabs/heartwood-tokens
```

#### Import _tokens.scss
The easiest way to consume Heartwood Tokens is to import them into a `.scss` file and use the variables generated by Style Dictionary.
```scss
@import "~@sprucelabs/heartwood-tokens/build/scss/tokens";
```
**Note:** depending on how you want to build your styles, it may be necessary to update your `webpack.config.js`, `gulpfile.js`, or whatever other build tool you're using.

#### Import _components.scss
Once global tokens are imported, you can also use component tokens.
```scss
@import "~@sprucelabs/heartwood-tokens/build/scss/components";
```

#### Theming
All of the variables generated in Heartwood Tokens use a `!default` flag to make theming easy. The best way to override variables is to import your overrides first, and then import tokens:
```scss
@import "my-theme.scss";
@import "~@sprucelabs/heartwood-tokens/build/scss/tokens";
@import "~@sprucelabs/heartwood-tokens/build/scss/components";
```

In `my-theme.scss`, you could for example change the primary color by adding:
```scss
$c__day-primary_base: #4c3cff;
```
**Recommended:** Make sure to look at [https://sprucelabsai.github.io/heartwood-tokens/](https://sprucelabsai.github.io/heartwood-tokens/) to see all the available tokens. Heartwood Tokens don't automatically generate full color palettes, so theming requires attention to detail to avoid unexpected results.

### Using assets
Visit [https://sprucelabsai.github.io/heartwood-tokens/assets](https://sprucelabsai.github.io/heartwood-tokens/assets) to download brand assets. You can also use these and icons by importing from the build directory: `build/js/assets-base64.js`.

### Figma
Checkout the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/ByFnA60kWEES79qherfepN/Heartwood-Tokens?node-id=0%3A1) to see and use Heartwood Tokens in your designs.

## Contributing
To get started, `git clone git@github.com:sprucelabsai/heartwood-tokens.git` and run `yarn` or `npm install`.

To build the tokens, run `npm run build`.

If you're adding assets like icons, these can be auto-generated with a script via: `node ./scripts/generateIcons`.

You can run the project's web view locally with `npm run develop`. This command cleans out the `build/` directory, generates assets, and builds tokens for all the platforms.
